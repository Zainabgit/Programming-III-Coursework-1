Introduction
This individual coursework requires developing and documenting a software application (console based or GUI based) using any Object-Oriented Programming language & compatible tools (of any version) for the below mentioned case study.
The coursework submission must include all 3 parts mentioned under the Deliverables Section below in one document, accompanied by all project files uploaded as a separate compressed folder
Deliverables
The coursework requires students to submit the following.
1.	Class diagram for the proposing system accompanied by suitable discussions highlighting the key design decisions.
2.	Source code of the proposing system demonstrating the use of;
i.	Classes and objects
ii.	Object Oriented Programming concepts
iii.	Data Structures
iv.	Relevant algorithms and patterns
3.	Test cases

The report submission should include the class diagram with discussions, key elements of the source code (no need to supply the entire source code within the report) presented along with any user interfaces, highlighting the data structures, algorithms and design patterns used, and the full set of test cases. The full source code should be available in the compressed folder you upload as part of the submission.
(Marks will only be awarded only if all the above criteria have been met)
Case study
“Tooth Care” is a small scale, private clinic situated in Nugegoda in order to provide dental services to out-patients who are unable to receive medical facilities from the government hospital.  There are two dental surgeons visiting the clinic. The available channeling dates and time are as follows.
Monday	06.00pm	-	09.00pm
Wednesday	06.00pm	-	09.00pm
Saturday	03.00pm	-	10.00pm
Sunday		03.00pm	-	10.00pm
Front office operator is responsible to book appointments for patients, by scanning through doctors’ consultation schedule for the date/s requested by a patient and then to inform the patient of the available options. If the patient is satisfied with a specific appointment time, they can reserve the appointment for that date and time by paying a registration fee of LKR 1000 and providing patient information such name, address and telephone number.
Once the patient has taken the treatment, the final fee is calculated according to the treatment type. The treatment types with fixed prices are as below, you may use an appropriate price at the implementation.
i.	Cleanings
ii.	Whitening
iii.	Filling
iv.	Nerve Filling
v.	Root Canal Therapy  

The proposed system should perform the following functions 
i.	Make appointments 
ii.	Update appointments details
iii.	View appointments details filtered by date
iv.	Search for an appointment using patient name or Appointment ID
v.	Accept Registration Fee when placing appointments
vi.	Calculate the total fee for the treatments after the appointment
vii.	Accept payment and generate an invoice for the payment

Further information and reminders:
1.	Use any standard UML tool to draw the class diagram. Clear images are required. Having watermarks in a non-disturbing way is fine. 
2.	You may select any Object-Oriented programming language. 
3.	Use of frameworks should be considered after careful evaluation. if the framework generates all the classes for you, marks will be deducted.
4.	User interfaces may take the form of a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is essential to evaluate the user experience in both UI/UX aspects of the chosen interface type. Note that the choice itself will not impact the grading; rather, focus on doing justice to your selected option. 
5.	Include clear screenshots of the codes and user interfaces as per the detailed instructions provided.
6.	For test cases, use a standard test case template.
